overview
--------

This is a collection of various useful classes and categories that I accumulated over time. Just take a look around and feel free to use and refine whatevers you want. You'll find short descriptions of the various elements below.

### NSSingletonObject

...is a singleton implementation as a direct subclass of NSObject, which means that you can turn any custom class that is derived from NSObject into a singleton simply by changing its superclass to NSSingletonObject.

The singleton base class can be used for multiple singletons inside the same scope. Any singleton based on it can also in turn be subclassed at will. Due to an optimized caching mechanism inside the -sharedInstance method, you can perform multiple consecutive calls to a specific singleton without any performance impact.

In other words:
```objective-c
Highlander *macLeod = [Highlander sharedInstance];
for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++)
  [macLeod doSomething];
```
..and..
```objective-c
for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++)
  [[Highlander sharedInstance] doSomething];
```
..have almost equal performance. Yes, I benchmarked it.

(BTW, I know I shouldn't have used the 'NS'-prefix for it but it just looks so nice in the interface declaration.. :) )
